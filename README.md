# Bloom Filter Project

## Compilation and Running

1. Ensure you have OpenSSL installed, specifically <openssl/md5.h>
2. Place `rockyou.ISO-8859-1.txt` and `dictionary.txt` in the same directory as `bloom_filter.c
3. Compile the code:
	Using the makefile:
	```bash
	make
	```
	I had trouble getting the makefile to function (it's probably just my computer) so alternatively, you can simply compile with:
   ```bash
   gcc -o bloom_filter bloom_filter.c -lssl -lcrypto
   ```
4. Ignore all the warnings generated by the compiler ðŸ˜Ž
5. Run the code:
   ```bash
   ./bloom_filter
   ```

## Optional High-Accuracy Mode
If you want to run the program with 100% accuracy, change BLOOM_SIZE to 481221388 and HASH_COUNT to 23. These are defined at the very beginning of 'bloom_filter.c'

The program uses
	```c
	BLOOM_SIZE 206237738
	HASH_COUNT 10
	```
by default for the sake of compatibility and not epicly crashing when being graded.
